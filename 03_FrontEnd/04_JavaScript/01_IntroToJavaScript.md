# JavaScript Engine 

<p> A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.</p>

JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model and Web IDL bindings. However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; 

<em> for example</em>, the [V8 Engine](https://v8.dev/) is a core component of the Node.js runtime system.

# V8 Engine

V8 is a JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by Google for its Chrome browser. V8 is free and open-source software that is part of the [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) project and also used separately in non-browser contexts, notably the <em>Node.js</em> runtime system.
